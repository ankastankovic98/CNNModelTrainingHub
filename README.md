# CNNModelTrainingHub

This project consists of several Jupyter notebooks focused on building and training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification tasks. CNNs are a type of deep learning architecture designed specifically to process and analyze visual data. They automatically learn hierarchical feature representations through convolutional layers, making them highly effective for tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and segmentation.

In these notebooks, we use the TensorFlow library,  to design, train, and evaluate different CNN architectures.

Through this work, the aim is to develop a solid understanding of convolutional neural networks and their practical usage in computer vision problems.
